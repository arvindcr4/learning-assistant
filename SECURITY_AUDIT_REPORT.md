**Issue:** Wildcard CORS origin in CSRF endpoint  
**Risk Level:** Medium  
**Fix Applied:**
- Implemented origin validation against allowed domains
- Added credential support for authenticated requests

### 9. **Content Security Policy Enhancement**
**Issue:** Missing CSP directives for comprehensive protection  
**Risk Level:** Low-Medium  
**Fix Applied:**
