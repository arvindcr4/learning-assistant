## Pipeline Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline is designed with the following principles:

- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel shards for faster feedback
- **Intelligent Test Selection**: Only relevant tests run based on changed files
- **Progressive Deployment**: Multiple deployment strategies (rolling, blue-green, canary)
- **Comprehensive Security**: Multi-layer security scanning throughout the pipeline
- **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance testing with regression detection
- **Infrastructure Automation**: Infrastructure as Code with automated provisioning

## Advanced Features

### Intelligent Test Selection

The pipeline includes an intelligent test selection system that analyzes changed files and runs only relevant tests:

```javascript
// Example usage in CI
npm run test:intelligent-selection
```

Features:
- **Dependency Analysis**: Maps test files to source dependencies
- **Change Detection**: Identifies modified files in the current commit
- **Smart Filtering**: Selects tests based on impact analysis
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces test execution time by up to 60%

### Parallel Test Execution

Tests are automatically distributed across multiple runners:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    shard: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Benefits:
- **Faster Feedback**: Parallel execution reduces total test time
- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient use of GitHub Actions runners
- **Scalability**: Easy to add more shards as test suite grows

### Advanced Caching

Multi-layer caching strategy:

1. **Dependencies**: npm packages, Node.js modules
2. **Build Artifacts**: Next.js build cache, TypeScript compilation
3. **Test Cache**: Jest cache, Playwright browsers
4. **Docker Layers**: Container image layers

## Testing Strategies

### Test Types and Coverage

| Test Type | Coverage | Execution |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Unit Tests | Individual functions/components | Parallel shards |
| Integration Tests | API endpoints, database | Service containers |
| E2E Tests | User workflows | Multiple browsers |
| Performance Tests | Load, stress, benchmarks | Dedicated runners |
| Accessibility Tests | WCAG compliance | Automated tools |
| Security Tests | Vulnerability scanning | Daily scans |

### Test Sharding Configuration

```yaml
# Unit tests across 4 shards
strategy:
  matrix:
    shard: [1, 2, 3, 4]

# E2E tests across browsers and shards
strategy:
  matrix:
    browser: [chromium, firefox, webkit]
    shard: [1, 2]
```

### Quality Gates

- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 80% threshold
- **Performance Budget**: Bundle size limits
- **Security Checks**: No critical vulnerabilities
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance

## Deployment Strategies

### Rolling Deployment

Default strategy for non-production environments:

```yaml
deployment_strategy: rolling
```

- **Zero Downtime**: Gradual replacement of instances
- **Risk Mitigation**: Rollback capability

### Blue-Green Deployment

Production deployment with parallel environments:

```yaml
deployment_strategy: blue-green
```

Features:
- **Instant Rollback**: Quick switch between environments
- **Risk Reduction**: Full testing before traffic switch
- **Zero Downtime**: Seamless traffic migration

Process:
1. Deploy to inactive environment (green)
2. Run comprehensive tests
3. Switch traffic from blue to green
4. Monitor for issues
5. Keep blue as rollback option

### Canary Deployment

Gradual traffic rollout for production:

```yaml
deployment_strategy: canary
```

Stages:
1. **5% Traffic**: Initial canary with monitoring
2. **25% Traffic**: Increased exposure with metrics
3. **50% Traffic**: Balanced load testing
4. **100% Traffic**: Full deployment completion

Monitoring:
- Error rates < 0.1%
- Response times within baseline
- User experience metrics
- Business KPIs
