## Security Considerations by Platform

### High Security Requirements
- Use **AWS**, **GCP**, or **Azure** for compliance (SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.)
- Implement all recommendations from [Security Best Practices](./security-best-practices.md)
- Enable audit logging and monitoring

### Standard Security
- **Fly.io**, **Render**, or **DigitalOcean** provide good security defaults
- Follow basic security practices from the security guide
- Use managed databases with SSL

### Development Security
- Any platform is suitable for development
- Use separate environments for development/production
- Never use production secrets in development

## Common Deployment Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Deployment
```bash
# Best for: Small apps, prototypes, personal projects
